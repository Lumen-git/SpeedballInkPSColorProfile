# SpeedballInkPSColorProfile
This profile was made using the PNG given on the Speedball website to quickly add the colors available to Photoshop. These colors are meant to give a rough estimate to what colors can be used in a print, and may not be 100% accurate to the retail inks or how they will appear once heat set.
