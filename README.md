# SpeedballInkPSColorProfile
This profile was made using the PNG given on the Speedball website to quickly add the colors available to Photoshop. These colors are meant to give a rough estimate to what colors can be used in a print, and may not be 100% accurate to the retail inks or how they will appear once heat set.

The .aco file is the color index, and the PNG is fron the Speedball site listing all of their colors. The names of the colors in the index match the names on the image.
